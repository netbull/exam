![Background pattern](./docs/schema.jpg)

## Requirements
- HEADER and FOOTER to be:

    - with full page width
- SIDEBAR 1 and SIDEBAR 2 to be:
    - with equal width of 100px
    - with height from HEADER to FOOTER
- BODY to be:
    - with background pattern `assets/img/bg.jpg`
    - with height from HEADER to FOOTER

- if there is nothing in the BODY the layout should be with full page height. The FOOTER will be on the bottom of the page and the BODY will not be scrollable.
- if there is more content inside the BODY the entire page gets scrollable as usual and the FOOTER will be visible when the page is scrolled at the bottom.
